<h1>Hobbies</h1>
<p>Adventures! I love being outside! Biking, hiking, bikepacking, trail running!</p>

<p>Floating in the river on paddleboard is another skill that I love! Scuba diving and going on scuba trips! Joining 
  local run groups! All things I love.</p>

<p>Recently I have taken up coding, and have fallen in love with the combination of problem-solving and building 
  something useful for people. I love helping others, and so if I can solve their coding related problems and live 
  an adventurous life, then I'm doing something awesome!
